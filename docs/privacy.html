        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use Prompt Studio ("the App"). We are committed to transparency and to protecting your privacy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no telemetry. Prompt Studio has no access to your usage data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>3. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All data created or entered in the App remains on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Keys</strong> — stored securely in the iOS Keychain</li>
            <li><strong>Prompts &amp; Versions</strong> — saved as local JSON files in Application Support</li>
            <li><strong>Vault Documents</strong> — stored in local app storage; text extraction happens on-device</li>
            <li><strong>App Preferences</strong> — stored in UserDefaults</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of this data is transmitted to Prompt Studio or any third party by the App itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>4. Third-Party AI Services</h2>
        <p>When you execute a prompt, the prompt text (and any attached vault context) is sent directly from your device to the AI provider you have selected. The App supports the following providers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anthropic (Claude)</li>
            <li>OpenAI (GPT)</li>
            <li>xAI (Grok)</li>
            <li>Google (Gemini)</li>
            <li>Mistral</li>
            <li>DeepSeek</li>
            <li>Perplexity</li>
            <li>Apple Intelligence (on-device)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each provider has its own privacy policy governing how it handles the data you send. Prompt Studio has no access to, and does not intercept, these transmissions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>5. API Keys</h2>
        <p>Your API keys are stored in the iOS Keychain, Apple's secure credential storage. They are never transmitted to Prompt Studio. Each key is sent only to the respective AI provider's API endpoint when you execute a prompt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>6. Vault Documents</h2>
        <p>Documents you import into the Vault are stored locally on your device. Text extraction and keyword indexing happen entirely on-device. Relevant passages are sent to AI providers only when you execute a prompt with vault context enabled.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>7. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
        <p>All subscription and payment processing is handled entirely by Apple via StoreKit. Prompt Studio does not receive, process, or store any payment information. Your transactions are subject to Apple's privacy policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be effective when the updated policy is posted within the App. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
    </div>
