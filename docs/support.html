    <div class="faq-item">

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
        <p>All your data stays on your device. Prompts, templates, vault documents, and preferences are stored locally. API keys are secured in the iOS Keychain. Nothing is sent to our servers — we don't have any.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What subscription tiers are available?</h3>
        <p>AI Prompt Studio offers a free tier with core features and a Pro subscription that unlocks the full experience, including unlimited prompts, all AI providers, and advanced vault capabilities. All payments are handled securely through Apple.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What file types can I import into the Vault?</h3>
        <p>The Vault supports a variety of document formats for context attachment, including PDF, plain text, Word documents, and more. Text extraction happens entirely on-device for your privacy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need an internet connection?</h3>
        <p>You need an internet connection to send prompts to cloud-based AI providers. However, Apple Intelligence runs on-device and works offline. Building and organizing prompts can be done without a connection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I add my API key?</h3>
        <p>Go to Settings within the app, select your AI provider, and paste your API key. It's stored securely in the iOS Keychain and is only sent to the provider's API when you run a prompt.</p>
